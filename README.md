Ideas for open source apps on Tycho.

## Ideas
- [TAP-0](TAP-0.md) – **Tycho Application Proposal Template**: Template.
- [TAP-1](TAP-1.md) – **Pool Explorer**: A UI to explore DEX pools. Filter for and explore pools, with low-latency, full coverage and reliable data.
- [TAP-2](TAP-2.md) – **Orderbook**: Access all on-chain liquidity like an orderbook. Including the routes and call data to execute at a price / depth.
- [TAP-3](TAP-3.md) – **Price Quoter**: A fast, trustless price oracle for all tokens.
- [TAP-4](TAP-4.md) – **Atomic Arbitrage**: A simple atomic arbitrage searcher.
- [TAP-5](TAP-5.md) – **Market Maker**: A simple market maker.
- [TAP-6](TAP-6.md) – **Cross-Chain Arbitrage**: A simple cross-chain arbitrage searcher.
- [TAP-7](TAP-7.md) – **Funding Rate Arbitrage**: Short on Hyperliquid, hedges with spot on a chain and auto-manage the position.
- [TAP-8](TAP-8.md) - **Markout Analyser**: A UI to track markouts for pool, router and taker addresses.

## Build an app
