Ideas for open source apps on Tycho.

## Ideas
- [TAP-0](TAP-0.md) – **Tycho Application Proposal Template**: Template.
- [TAP-1](TAP-1.md) – **Pool Explorer**: A UI to explore DEX pools. Filter for, and explore pools, with low-latency, full coverage and reliable data.
- [TAP-2](TAP-2.md) – **Orderbook**: Access all on-chain liquidity like an orderbook. Including the routes to execute at a price / depth.
- [TAP-3](TAP-3.md) – **Price Oracle**: A fast, trustless price oracle covering all tokens, based on on-chain data – that anyone can use to get real-time, on-chain prices and spreads.

## Build an app
- **Get inspiration**: Use the ideas above to build apps on Tycho for the community.
- **Share what you built**: Add a link to your app in the relevant TAP.
- **Get support on telegram**: Get support from Tycho community and maintainers in our tg group: [tycho.build](https://tycho.build/)
