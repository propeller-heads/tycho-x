# Tycho X
Ideas for apps on Tycho.

## Ideas
- [TAP-0](TAP-0.md) – **Tycho Application Proposal Template**: Template.
- [TAP-1](TAP-1.md) – **Pool Explorer**: A local UI to explore DEX pools. Filter for, and explore DEX pools, with low-latency, full coverage and trustlessly reliable data.
- [TAP-2](TAP-2.md) – **Orderbook**: All on-chain liquidity for a token pair presented in familiar orderbook format. Including the routes to execute at a price / depth.
