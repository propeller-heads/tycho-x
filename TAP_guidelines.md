## How to Participate

As a bounty hunter, please follow this process:

1. **Review the TAP**: Thoroughly understand the Tycho Application Proposal you want to implement.
    
2. **Write an implementation plan**: Create a detailed plan on HackMD covering:
    - **Core logic specifics**: How you'll implement the essential requirements
    - **Tycho integration**: Explanation of how you'll use Tycho's features
    - **Weekly milestones**: One-liner goals for each week of development
    - **Technical architecture**: Information flow, data structures, and system design
    - **UI/UX approach**: How you'll implement the user scenarios
    - **About You**: Add a paragraph on you (and your team): What makes you succeed in this TAP (+relevant experience). Add your Github (& X) handles.
      
3. **Submit your plan**: DM **@tanay_j on Telegram** with your HackMD link (make sure the link is set to public viewing)
    
4. **Selection**: We'll review all submissions and select the best plan.

# Project Sequence
---
1. **Planning** (Week 0): Finalize implementation plan with feedback.
2. **Core Implementation** (Weeks 1-N): Build essential requirements and deploy hosted UI.
3. **Feedback & Polish** (Week N+1): Team review, iterate on feedback, refine UI, update documentation.
4. **Launch Prep** (Final week): Prep launch content, announcement.

# What We Expect
---
This is in addition to the requirements laid out in the TAP.

## Code & Architecture
- **Production-ready**: Clean, documented, tested code
- **Full protocol coverage**: Support all DEXs/protocols and chains that Tycho supports
- **UI deployment**: UIs must support local execution and public hosting

## Documentation
- **User guides**: Complete documentation for all user scenarios
- **Technical docs**: API references, architecture diagrams, deployment guides

## Communication
- **Weekly updates**: Progress reports in the **tycho.build** TAP builders channel
- **Proactive blockers**: Communicate obstacles as they arise
- **Launch participation**: Help create videos, demos, and blog posts

# What We Provide
---
- **Product input**: Full product support throughout the process
- **Design resources**: UI mockups and full support from our in-house designer
- **DevOps**: End-to-end support for scalable hosting infrastructure from our partner devops engineers
- **Expense reimbursement**: Domains, hosting, and operational costs are covered
- **Community**: Active Telegram channel with fellow builders who you can ask for support and feedback

> [!NOTE] Engineering support from the Tycho core team is limited. Our docs and community should help you navigate technical challenges independently.
