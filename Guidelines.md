## How to Participate

Each interested bounty hunter must follow this process:

1. **Review the TAP**: Thoroughly understand the Tycho Application Proposal you want to implement
    
2. **Write an implementation plan**: Create a detailed plan on HackMD covering (but not limited to):
    - **Core logic specifics**: How you'll implement the essential requirements
    - **Tycho integration**: Explanation of how you'll use Tycho's features
    - **Weekly milestones**: One-liner goals for each week of development
    - **Technical architecture**: Information flow, data structures, and system design
    - **UI/UX approach**: How you'll implement the user scenarios 
      
3. **Submit your plan**: DM **@tanay_j on Telegram** with your HackMD link (make sure the link is set to public viewing)
    
4. **Selection**: We'll review all submissions and select the best plan
    
5. **Kick-off**: Once selected, coordinate with the team to begin implementation

# Project Sequence
---
1. **Planning** (Week 0): Finalize implementation plan with feedback
2. **Core Implementation** (Weeks 1-N): Build essential requirements and deploy hosted UI
3. **Feedback & Polish** (Week N+1): Team review, iterate on feedback, refine UI, update documentation
4. **Launch Prep** (Final week): Prep launch conten, announcement
